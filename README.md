# travelingSalesmanParalleled

Description:


This is a school project where I was tasked to use parallel programming to find the most effiecient path between two cities given the distance of said cities, the starting position (0) and the end postion.
This project was built on top of a sequential version of this solution that I was tasked with before this project. Parallel programming was implemented in order to calculate an answer within a quicker time frame. 

How To Use:


Dowload files and open "traveling salesman paralleled.sln" in Visual Studio. Once open, find line 127 and replace the file address to the address of the tsp.txt file you dowloaded onto your computer.
If the address is correct, when you run the program you should see a terminal window with "sequential time," indicating the time it took the solution to be calculated,
"length," indicating the length from 0 to the specified city in the first line of the file, and finally, each city within the calculated path.
